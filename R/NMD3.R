identifyNMDexons <- function(x, NMD.result = NULL) {
  
  # checks etc, will add later
  ## check for x format, check for CDS
  ## check for NMD.result, if yes check if all tx have NMD annotation
  
  # get reference CDS transcript for each gene
  
  # get AS segments between NMD transcript and reference transcript
  
  # recreate hypothetical tx by inserting/removing AS segments
  #### difficult bit
  
  # test NMD again
