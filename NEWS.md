# *factR* v.1.0.0

We are pleased to announce the release of *factR* v.1.0. This bioinformatics 
workflow is now published in the Methods in Molecular Biology book series 
entitled [**Alternative splicing**](add-link-in-future). 

## Core features
1. Construct transcript coding (CDS) information using a reference-guided process
2. Predict protein domains on coding transcripts
3. Predict sensitivity of coding transcripts to Nonsense-mediated decay
 
## Supporting features 
1. Match chromosome levels of query GTF/object to reference annotation
2. Match gene_id and gene_names of query GTF to reference annotation
3. Plot transcripts from GTF GRanges object using *wiggleplotr*
4. Select new transcripts from custom transcriptome
